# landho-crud

Create crud services using [landho](https://github.com/elishacook/landho), [rethinkdb](http://rethinkdb.com/) and [feelings](https://github.com/elishacook/feelings).

There is a companion [client library](https://github.com/elishacook/landho-crud-client) that makes for a nice experience using these services.

## Install

```bash
npm install landho landho-crud
```

## Quick start

Sorely lacking in documentation right now. See the tests for comprehensive, if dense, information about how to use the library.
